# KYC - Know Your Contacts!

In this hard times of the pandemic, it's hard to get to know your closest contacts. 

Besides, most people don't like to share their information publicly. 

A case in Uganda was that the riders take note of everyone's name, phone number, national identification number of the person they were carrying, and this ended the struggle for contacts tracing. 

This app is aimed at bridging this gap for Uganda and world wide without the need of giving headaches in terms of the hardware usage such as Bluetooth or WiFi connectivities. 

This is to make it a choice for an individual to know their contacts both online and offline.
