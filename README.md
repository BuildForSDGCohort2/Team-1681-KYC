_KYC_ - Know Your Contacts

In this hard times of the pandemic, it's hard to get to know your _closest_ _contacts_. 

Besides, most people don't like to share their information publicly. 

A case in **Uganda** was that the riders take note of everyone's 
1 **name**, 
2 **phone number**,
3 **national identification number (NIN)**
of the person they were carrying, and this ended the struggle for contacts tracing. 

This app is aimed at bridging this gap for **Uganda** and **world wide** without the need of giving headaches in terms of the hardware usage such as Bluetooth or WiFi connectivities. 

This is to make it a choice for an individual to know their contacts both online and offline.

This app is designed of the following basis
- [x] Hiding User identity and information
- [x] Making it a choice for the users to allow them identify the time they need to know their contacts.
- [x] An implementable system for all public areas
- [x] An alert or notification due to close contacts being infected.
- [x] An option to jote down the assigned persons number and code to be entered in a later time if one does not hold a smartphone or \n does not own one. This can be updated on web.
- [x] Updates for infections done by a responsive body
- [x] Search for contacts based on date, meeting location or NIN.
